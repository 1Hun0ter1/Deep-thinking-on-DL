# Deep-thinking-on-DL

## 🔥Target

​	This repository aims to help you think deeply on DL and inspired by an article: [How to follow new technology](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/605sBrKPm_c8wR2Ajn3ZVQ)

​	Up to now, I have upload two files:

- **column**:

  ​	All contents on thinking will be found in it.

- **tips**:

  ​	Some useful references for you to create your own repository like this.

> 😀Today, we are gathered here to better understand the knowledge of deep learning, and the sharing deserves a  star⭐ of support and encouragement for all the "audience"! [^1]
